{"name":"Freecell","tagline":"Windows NT Freecell for other computers","body":"### Freecell\r\nSince the beginning of time, people have wasted time on the fun, tireless game of Freecell. Since Windows 95, freecell.exe has been in the `C:\\Windows\\system32` folder, until Windows Vista. Vista ruined everything. Lives, businesses, relationships, UAC and other 'features' wrecked havoc on the world and Microsoft's stock, it even ruined freecell.exe. Today, balance has been restored, as the original freecell.exe has been attained and is now readily available, if you are willing to work.\r\n\r\nFirst, download the .zip and unzip it.\r\n\r\nNext, open cmd inside the folder.\r\n\r\nRun:\r\n`expand freecell.ex_ freecell.exe`\r\nand \r\n`expand cards.dl_ cards.dll`\r\n\r\nMove those two files into a directory you'd like to keep Freecell.\r\nDone!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
